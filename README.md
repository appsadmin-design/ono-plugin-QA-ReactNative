# ono-plugin-QA-ReactNative

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin for the QA team, run in **parallel** with `ono-react-native-dev-plugin`'s dev SDLC pipeline rather than after it. QA authors a test plan grounded in Figma and/or a spec/LLD while dev is still implementing, approves it, keeps it in sync as the design/spec changes, then — once dev delivers their QA handoff notes — checks the approved test plan against what was actually built to surface untested edge cases before test execution starts.

## Relationship to the dev plugin and repos

Each mobile project has two repos: the **code repo** (dev works here; `ono-react-native-dev-plugin` runs here; its `/create-dev-qa-notes` command writes the completed QA handoff doc here) and a separate **QA repo** on Bitbucket (QA has write access; this plugin writes test plans and coverage reports here). **This plugin never commits or pushes to either repo** — the QA engineer always reviews the diff and pushes manually.

## Required setup: a workspace root containing both repos

This plugin needs to read from the code repo and write to the QA repo in the same session, so QA should clone both repos as **direct children of one shared workspace folder**, and launch Claude Code from that workspace root — not from inside either repo individually:

```
qa-workspace/              ← launch `claude` from here
├── ono-app-x/              ← code repo (git)
└── ono-app-x-qa/           ← QA repo (git), name contains "qa"
```

Since the workspace root itself is **not** a git repo, install the plugin **"for me"** rather than "for me and this repo" when prompted — the commands work the same regardless of which folder they're launched from, as long as it's the workspace root described above.

If the plugin is launched from a folder that doesn't match this shape (e.g. from inside a single repo, or a workspace with the wrong number of repos), it stops and asks rather than guessing — see "Resolving the workspace" below.

## Install

From the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add appsadmin-design/ono-plugin-marketplace
/plugin install ono-plugin-QA-ReactNative@ono-plugin-marketplace
```

Local (for development of the plugin itself):

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/ono-plugin-QA-ReactNative
```

## Quick start

```
# Run from the workspace root (see "Required setup" above)

# Phase 1 — while dev is implementing
/create-qa-test-plan checkout-redesign https://figma.com/file/... --spec=./checkout-redesign-lld.md
#  → writes ono-app-x-qa/checkout-redesign/test-plan.md, status: draft

/approve-qa-test-plan checkout-redesign
#  → flips status: approved once you're satisfied with the plan

# If the design/spec changes before dev hands off:
/sync-qa-test-plan checkout-redesign
#  → refreshes test-plan.md against its recorded sources, appends a Change Log entry
#     (resets status to draft if the change was substantive)

# Phase 2 — after dev hands off (dev has run /create-dev-qa-notes)
/check-qa-coverage checkout-redesign
#  → requires test-plan.md's status to be "approved"; writes ono-app-x-qa/checkout-redesign/coverage-report.md

# Then: review the diffs in the QA repo yourself and commit/push
```

## Commands

| Command | Arguments | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/create-qa-test-plan` | feature name, Figma link (optional), `--spec=` (optional), `--code-repo=`/`--qa-repo=` (optional overrides) | Authors a QA test plan from Figma and/or a spec/LLD, independent of dev's progress |
| `/approve-qa-test-plan` | feature name, `--qa-repo=` (optional override) | Marks a QA test plan `approved`, required before `/check-qa-coverage` will run |
| `/sync-qa-test-plan` | feature name, `--qa-repo=` (optional override) | Re-checks a test plan's recorded sources for changes and updates it with a dated change log |
| `/check-qa-coverage` | feature name, dev handoff path (optional), `--code-repo=`/`--qa-repo=` (optional overrides) | Compares an **approved** QA test plan against dev's completed QA handoff notes and reports coverage gaps |

## Pipeline

| Phase | Command | Skill | Agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Test planning | `/create-qa-test-plan` | `qa-test-planning` | `qa-test-designer` |
| 1. Approval | `/approve-qa-test-plan` | — (frontmatter edit) | — |
| 1. Sync (as needed) | `/sync-qa-test-plan` | `qa-test-plan-sync` | `qa-test-plan-syncer` |
| 2. Coverage check | `/check-qa-coverage` | `qa-coverage-analysis` | `qa-coverage-reviewer` |

Phase 1 depends on nothing but a Figma link and/or a spec/LLD doc — it can run the moment a feature is designed/specified, in parallel with dev's implementation. A test plan must be approved via `/approve-qa-test-plan` before Phase 2 will run against it; `/sync-qa-test-plan` can be run any time beforehand (or after) to catch up with design/spec changes, and resets approval if it makes a substantive change. Phase 2 depends on both an approved Phase 1 test plan and the dev plugin's `qa-handoff-template.md` output for the same feature, so it only runs once dev has handed off.

## Resolving the workspace

Both commands resolve the code repo and QA repo paths in this order, stopping to ask if the layout doesn't resolve unambiguously:

1. Explicit `--code-repo=`/`--qa-repo=` paths passed in the command's arguments.
2. `.claude/qa-workspace.json` in the workspace root (current working directory) — a local cache: `{"codeRepoPath": "...", "qaRepoPath": "..."}`.
3. Auto-detect: list the working directory's immediate subdirectories that contain a `.git` folder. If exactly two are found and exactly one has `qa` in its name, that's the QA repo and the other is the code repo — this mapping is then offered to be cached to `.claude/qa-workspace.json`.
4. Otherwise — e.g. the current folder is itself a git repo (wrong launch point), or there aren't exactly two identifiable repos — the command stops, explains what it actually found, and asks the human to clarify which folder is which or to relaunch from the correct workspace root.

Within the QA repo, artifacts are organized per feature: `<feature-slug>/test-plan.md` and `<feature-slug>/coverage-report.md`.

## Safety hooks

One hook is always active while the plugin is installed:

| Hook | What it does |
|---|---|
| `block-qa-repo-git-writes` | Blocks any `git commit`/`git push` run via Bash while this plugin is active. It only ever writes Markdown files — the QA engineer always reviews and pushes manually. |

## MCP servers

- **`figma`** (`https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`) — the hosted Figma MCP server, used by `/create-qa-test-plan` to inspect the actual screens/states/frames a feature's test plan is grounded in. Each QA engineer authenticates once via OAuth on first use (`/mcp` to check connection status).
