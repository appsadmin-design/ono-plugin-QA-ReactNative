description: Methodology for refreshing an existing QA test plan against its recorded sources (Figma, spec/LLD, other docs) after they change, with a clear change log. Used by /sync-qa-test-plan via the qa-test-plan-syncer agent.

## Methodology

1. **Read the existing test plan in full**, especially its "Input Sources" table and the current content of every section — this is the baseline to diff against.
2. **Re-inspect each listed source at its current state**: re-run the relevant `figma` MCP calls for any Figma source, re-read any local file path directly, and best-effort re-fetch any link-based spec/LLD. If a source can't be re-fetched automatically, ask the human to paste its current content or share an updated copy rather than assuming nothing changed.
3. **Diff conceptually, section by section** (Screens & Flows Covered, Functional Test Cases, Edge Cases, i18n/RTL, Accessibility, Open Questions): identify what's newly present, what changed, and what a source now contradicts or no longer shows.
4. **Never remove a test case just because it wasn't re-derived.** Only mark something stale or remove it when a refreshed source actively contradicts or removes what it was testing. Anything in the plan that isn't traceable to a source at all is treated as QA-authored and left untouched.
5. **Update the plan in place** with additions/changes, keeping the existing ID scheme and table shapes.
6. **Append one dated "Change Log" entry** describing exactly what was added, changed, or flagged stale, and which source triggered each change. Never edit or remove a past entry.
7. **If the plan's `status` was `approved` and anything substantive changed**, reset `status` to `draft` and clear `approved_by`/`approved_date`, and say so explicitly in the new Change Log entry so it's clear re-approval is needed. If nothing substantive changed, leave `status` untouched.

## Unchanged constraints

- Never read the code repo, dev's implementation plan, or dev's QA handoff doc.
- Don't invent a change that isn't traceable to an actual difference in a source.
