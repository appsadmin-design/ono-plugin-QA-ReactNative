# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- `/create-qa-test-plan` no longer silently continues or hard-stops when the code repo sibling is missing from the workspace — it now pauses, explains that Phase 1 doesn't need the code repo but `/check-qa-coverage` will, and asks the human whether to continue anyway or stop to complete the workspace first.
- `/check-qa-coverage` now asks the human for the dev QA handoff doc's path/link upfront, mirroring how `/create-qa-test-plan` asks for Figma/spec — it only falls back to searching the code repo for the doc if the human explicitly opts into a search, instead of always searching by default.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-07

### Changed
- Renamed the plugin from `ono-plugin-QA-ReactNative` to `ono-plugin-qa` and generalized its description to cover React, React Native, iOS, and Android — the plugin's actual test-planning and coverage-analysis logic has never had any platform-specific assumptions, so this is a branding/naming fix, not a behavior change.
- Updated all references to the companion dev plugin from its old name `ono-react-native-dev-plugin` to its current name `ono-mobile-dev-plugin`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- `/approve-qa-test-plan` command — marks a test plan `approved`, now required before `/check-qa-coverage` will run.
- `/sync-qa-test-plan` command and `qa-test-plan-syncer` agent — re-checks a test plan's recorded sources for changes and appends a dated change log entry, resetting approval if the change was substantive.
- `--spec=` option on `/create-qa-test-plan` — test plans can now be grounded in a spec/LLD document in addition to or instead of a Figma link (either source skippable with a stated reason), with every source used recorded for later re-checks.

### Changed
- Repo resolution now expects a shared workspace root containing the code repo and QA repo as direct subfolders (auto-detected by git-repo presence and "qa" in the folder name), instead of assuming the QA repo is a filesystem sibling of the code repo — the old assumption broke under Claude Code's sandboxed file access.
- `/check-qa-coverage` now requires the test plan's status to be `approved` before it will run.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Initial release: two-phase Claude Code plugin for QA, run in parallel with `ono-react-native-dev-plugin`.
- `/create-qa-test-plan` command and `qa-test-designer` agent — authors a QA test plan from a feature's Figma design independent of dev's progress.
- `/check-qa-coverage` command and `qa-coverage-reviewer` agent — diffs the QA test plan against the dev plugin's QA handoff notes to surface untested edge cases.
