Author a QA test plan for the feature in `$ARGUMENTS`, from its Figma design and/or spec/LLD alone. This runs in parallel with dev's implementation — it does not read or wait for any `ono-react-native-dev-plugin` output.

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for a feature name, an optional Figma URL (a `figma.com/...` link), and an optional `--spec=` path or link.
2. Resolve the workspace layout to find the QA repo path (see "Resolving the workspace" below) — do this before any Figma/spec inspection so a workspace problem is caught before spending that effort.
3. Slugify the feature name (lowercase, hyphens, punctuation stripped). If `<qa-repo-path>/<feature-slug>/test-plan.md` already exists, stop and tell the human to use `/sync-qa-test-plan` instead — never silently overwrite an existing plan.
4. Ask the human once, upfront, in a single pause: confirm/collect the Figma link (if not already given), confirm/collect the spec/LLD link or path (if not already given via `--spec=`), and invite anything else they'd like to share (notes, other docs). If Figma or spec/LLD genuinely doesn't apply (e.g. no UI, no formal spec written yet), capture the stated reason rather than leaving it blank.
5. Require at least one real source (Figma, spec/LLD, or another supplied doc) after that ask. If truly none exist, stop and ask again — don't draft test cases from a feature name alone.
6. Apply the `qa-test-planning` skill methodology via the `qa-test-designer` agent, passing it the feature name and every source gathered (including the stated reasons for anything marked not applicable).
7. The agent inspects the actual Figma frames/screens/states via the `figma` MCP server (`get_metadata`, `get_design_context`, `get_screenshot`) where a Figma link exists, reads the spec/LLD where one exists, and derives functional test cases, edge/negative cases, and open questions grounded strictly in those sources — it does not invent flows they don't show.
8. Have the agent populate `templates/qa-test-plan-template.md` in full, including "Input Sources" with every source consulted (or marked `N/A — <reason>`).
9. Write the populated document to `<qa-repo-path>/<feature-slug>/test-plan.md`, creating the folder if needed, with `status: draft`.
10. Never run `git add`/`commit`/`push` in the QA repo. Tell the human the file was written, that they should review the diff, and that they should run `/approve-qa-test-plan` once satisfied before `/check-qa-coverage` can be used later.

## Resolving the workspace

This plugin expects Claude Code to be launched from a **workspace root** folder containing exactly two git repos as direct subfolders: the project's code repo and its QA repo. Resolve in this order:

1. Explicit `--code-repo=` / `--qa-repo=` paths in `$ARGUMENTS`, if given.
2. `.claude/qa-workspace.json` in the current working directory — a local cache (not necessarily git-tracked, since the workspace root itself may not be a repo): `{"codeRepoPath": "...", "qaRepoPath": "..."}`, paths relative to the working directory unless absolute.
3. Auto-detect: list the working directory's immediate subdirectories that contain a `.git` folder.
   - If exactly two are found and exactly one has `qa` (case-insensitive) in its folder name, that one is the QA repo and the other is the code repo. Offer to cache this mapping to `.claude/qa-workspace.json`.
   - Otherwise, the layout doesn't match what this plugin expects — stop and explain plainly what was actually found (e.g. "the current folder itself is a git repo, which usually means Claude Code was launched from inside a single repo instead of the shared workspace root", or "found 3 git repos, expected 2", or "found 2 git repos but couldn't tell which is which by name"). Ask the human to either tell you which folder is which, or relaunch Claude Code from the correct workspace root. Cache their answer to `.claude/qa-workspace.json` if given.
