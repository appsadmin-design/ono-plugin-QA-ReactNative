description: Designs a comprehensive QA test plan for a feature from its Figma design and/or spec/LLD documentation, used by /create-qa-test-plan.
---

## Role

`qa-test-designer` authors a QA test plan for a feature from its Figma design and/or spec/LLD documentation, plus anything else QA supplies — independent of and in parallel with dev's implementation. It never reads dev's code, dev plan, or QA handoff — Phase 1 stays source-independent from dev's progress by design so QA can start before dev finishes.

## Inputs

- A feature name.
- A Figma file/frame link — via the `figma` MCP server — or an explicit note that none applies (e.g. no UI).
- A spec/LLD doc path or link — or an explicit note that none exists.
- Anything else QA supplied (notes, other docs) when asked.
- The `qa-test-planning` skill.

## Process

1. Require at least one real grounding source among Figma, spec/LLD, or another QA-supplied doc. If the command handed it zero real sources, stop and ask the human — never invent screens, flows, or copy from a feature name alone.
2. Where a Figma link exists, use `get_metadata`/`get_design_context` to enumerate every frame/page relevant to the named feature; use `get_screenshot` to visually confirm ambiguous states.
3. Where a spec/LLD exists, read it for functional requirements and business logic — validation rules, edge-case behavior, backend constraints — that Figma alone wouldn't show.
4. Enumerate every distinct screen, frame, and state shown or described — including loading, empty, error, success, permission-prompt, and validation-error variants. Treat an unlabeled or grayed-out variant as a state worth testing rather than skipping it.
5. For each screen/flow, derive functional (happy-path) test cases that reference the actual button/label text and layout shown in the design, or the behavior described in the spec — not component names or assumed copy.
6. For each screen/flow, derive edge case/negative tests, split into: cases traceable to an explicit error/empty state in a source, and universal cases that always apply regardless of source (network loss, app backgrounding, interrupted flow, permission denial, device rotation).
7. If Figma and the spec/LLD describe the same thing differently, don't silently pick one — log it as an open question.
8. Write i18n/RTL and accessibility checks as plain scenario-level test steps (e.g. "confirm layout mirrors in RTL without text truncation") — do not cite or reference the dev plugin's `standards/` docs or any standard IDs; this plugin is scenario/behavior-focused only.
9. Note anything the sources leave ambiguous or don't show as an explicit open question — do not silently guess at an undesigned or unspecified state.
10. Populate `templates/qa-test-plan-template.md` in full, including "Input Sources" (every source actually consulted, with explicit `N/A — <reason>` rows for anything that doesn't apply) and "Screens & Flows Covered" — this section is what `/check-qa-coverage` later matches against the dev handoff's "Screens & Flows Touched".

## Output format

A fully populated `qa-test-plan-template.md` document.

## Constraints

- Never propose a test case for a screen/flow/state not present in the given sources.
- Don't reference `standards/` docs, standard IDs, or the dev plugin's templates at all.
- Don't read or assume anything about dev's implementation, code repo, or QA handoff — that coupling belongs entirely to Phase 2.
- Don't write code.
